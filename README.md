> Complete development toolkit for [Arc Database](https://github.com/basekick-labs/arc) - the high-performance time-series data warehouse.

## Features

- **Connections** - multiple saved servers, tokens stored in the system keychain, health status in the sidebar and status bar.
- **Queries** - SQL IntelliSense for tables, columns and DuckDB functions. Run with `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter`. Results export to CSV, JSON or Markdown, and time-series results chart automatically.
- **Notebooks** - mix SQL and Markdown in `.arcnb` files, run cells individually or all at once, substitute variables into queries, export to Markdown with results.
- **Schema explorer** - browse databases and tables; right-click any table to preview data, show its schema or statistics, or generate a query.
- **Data ingestion** - CSV import with delimiter/header detection and batched writes, plus a generator for CPU, memory, network, IoT and custom test data. Both use MessagePack columnar format.
- **Alerts** - run a query on an interval and get a desktop notification when the result crosses a threshold. Five conditions, alert history, enable/disable without deleting.
- **Query management** - automatic history and saved queries, with execution time, row counts and errors.
- **Tokens** - create, rotate, verify and delete Arc server tokens from the sidebar.
- **Themes** - adapts to Light, Dark and High Contrast automatically, charts included.

See **[FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md)** for the full guide.

## Quick Start

1. Install **Arc Database Manager** from the VS Code marketplace.
2. Click **"Arc: Not Connected"** in the status bar and enter your host, port, protocol and token.
3. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Arc: New Query**, write SQL, and press `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter`.

Requires VS Code 1.85+, a reachable Arc instance, and an Arc authentication token.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `arc.defaultHost` | `localhost` | Default Arc server host |
| `arc.defaultPort` | `8000` | Default Arc server port |
| `arc.defaultProtocol` | `http` | Default protocol (`http` or `https`) |
| `arc.queryTimeout` | `30000` | Query timeout in milliseconds |
| `arc.maxResults` | `1000` | Maximum rows displayed in results |
| `arc.resultFormat` | `json` | Result format (`json` or `arrow`) |
| `arc.telemetry.enabled` | `true` | Send an anonymous daily install beacon (see [Telemetry](#telemetry)) |

## Commands

Everything is under `Arc:` in the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) - connecting, queries, notebooks, CSV import, test data, alerts and the schema explorer. `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter` executes the current query.

## Examples

Time-series analysis with a moving average:

```sql
SELECT
  time,
  usage_user,
  AVG(usage_user) OVER (
    ORDER BY time
    ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS moving_avg
FROM telegraf.cpu
WHERE host = 'server01'
  AND time > now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
ORDER BY time DESC;
```

A parameterized notebook cell, where variables defined in the notebook are substituted before the query runs:

```sql
SELECT * FROM ${database}.${measurement}
WHERE time > now() - INTERVAL ${interval}
LIMIT 100;
```

An alert that fires when memory stays above 90%:

```
Query:     SELECT AVG(used_percent) FROM mem WHERE time > now() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE
Condition: greater_than 90
Interval:  60s
```

## Performance

CSV import and the data generator sustain roughly 50k-200k rows/second using MessagePack columnar writes, with progress reporting on large files. Query results render up to `arc.maxResults` rows.

## Telemetry

The extension sends one anonymous beacon per day so we can count installs and see which versions are in use. It contains a randomly generated install ID, the extension and editor version, and the OS name and architecture - **never** queries, results, table names, server hostnames, or tokens. The install ID is generated locally and is not derived from your machine or account, so it cannot be tied to you or correlated across products.

Turn it off with `arc.telemetry.enabled`, or disable telemetry across VS Code with `telemetry.telemetryLevel: off` - either one is enough.

## Troubleshooting

**Cannot connect** - check Arc is up (`curl http://localhost:8000/health`), confirm host and port, then run **Arc: Verify Token**.

**Query timeout** - add a time filter (`WHERE time > now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR`) and a `LIMIT`, or raise `arc.queryTimeout`.

**Import fails** - confirm the file is UTF-8 and the delimiter is right; try a small file first to isolate the problem.
